## Liquidity Risk in Banking

Liquidity risk is the risk that a bank will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they come due.
This can happen if a bank does not have enough cash on hand to meet withdrawals or other obligations.
Banks must manage liquidity risk carefully to avoid a liquidity crisis.
A liquidity crisis can lead to a bank run, which can cause the bank to fail.
